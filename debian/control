Description: import exceptions from bundled packages in requests. - Python 2.7
 The python requests library bundles the urllib3 library, however, some
 software distributions (like Debian) modify requests to remove the bundled
 library. This makes some operations, such as supressing the "insecure platform
 warning" messages that urllib emits difficult. This is a simple library to
 find the correct path to exceptions in the requests library regardless of
 whether they are bundled.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.7 module.
